# module-2-challenge
In this challenge I have created my own portfolio. meaning I set up three sections. About me, projects, and contact me.

In section "about me" I started intrudusing myself and a little bit of background. I also wrote about what I am willing to become and why I attanded coding boot camp.

Since I have no history of coding in the past, I only linked the one challenge I did i the last module. SO DO NOT PANIC IF ALL THE IMAGES LINKED TO ONE WEBSITE.
Also FYI, my favorite color is purple. not obvious at all!
